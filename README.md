This is the resources used in the benchmark conducted for the "Recent advances and investigation of NewSQL for OLTP and OLAP in Big Data" research report

Sysbench (https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench) was used to conduct OLTP benchmarking, while TPC-DS kit (https://github.com/gregrahn/tpcds-kit) was used to generate OLAP benchmarking data and queries.

Disclaimer: The benchmark results obtained are derived from the TPC-C and TPC-DS benchmarks and do not comply with the TPC-C and TPC-DS Specification

[Update]
This research is also published as a conference paper titled: "Recent Advances and Benchmarking of NewSQL for OLTP and OLAP in the Big Data Age" available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10164996.
